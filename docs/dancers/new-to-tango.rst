Carlos Di Sarli

A guide to the recordings best-suited for dancers first learning to hear the rhythm of Argentine tango music.

Overview
---------
Outside of Argentina, most people do not grow up hearing tango music. 
Consequently, many beginning dancers face the challenge of finding music that is useful 
for learning to hear and move to the beat of tango. 
Many instructors recommend beginning with the music of the Carlos Di Sarli orchestra, 
and we consider that a good recommendation.

We think, however, that the beginning dancer will do better by listening and 
moving to the tangos on Francisco Canaro's La Melodia de Nuestro Adios and 
Miguel Caló's Yo Soy el Tango before moving onto Di Sarli. 
The tangos on these two CDs are among the very best for learning the 
walking rhythm of tango because they have a clear and simple beat that 
is stronger and closer to a walking tempo than that found on Di Sarli recordings. 
We recommend working with the tangos on the Canaro CD first because they 
are somewhat slower in tempo than those on the Caló CD.

After learning to move to the tangos on the two Canaro and Caló CDs, many 
beginning dancers are ready to listen and move to the instrumental tangos 
of Carlos Di Sarli.  
The best available Di Sarli CD is Solo Tango: Instrumental Vol. 1. 
The tangos on this CD have a clear and simple walking beat for dancing. 
The release RCA Victor 100 Años is nearly as good.  
The Tango Argentino release Instrumental is a decent third choice.  
For those wishing to add a vocal dimension to Di Sarli's music, the CDs 
Sus Primeros Exitos, vol. 1 with singer Roberto Rufino or 
Porteño y Bailarin (Tango Argentino) with vocalist Jorge Duran 
are outstanding choices.

After learning to move to Di Sarli, the beginning dancer is ready to 
move onto the rhythm king, Juan D'Arienzo. 
To learn to hear and move to the 2x4 rhythms of Juan D'Arienzo, 
El Esquinazo 1937-1938, or Instrumental, vol. 1 are the best choices.  
For D'Arienzo, El Esquinazo has the best set of tracks in the best-sounding 
collection of D' Arienzo's classics.  
Instrumental, vol. 1 has more of D' Arienzo's classic instrumentals 
than any other CD and very good sound quality.  
Other choices are Sus Primeros Exitos vol. 1, 
Sus Primeros Exitos vol. 2, or 
El Rey del Compas.

After D'Arienzo comes the more subtle Anibal Troilo and 
Ricardo Tanturi with Alberto Castillo.  
The CDs Yo Soy El Tango (Troilo en RCA) and 
Instrumental (Tango Argentino) are the best choices 
for Troilo's early instrumentals.  
The CD Troilo/Fiorentino (Solo Tango) captures Troilo with 
the vocalist Francisco Fiorentino.  
Much of the best material from these three CDs can be 
found on the more widely available 
El Inmortal Pichuco (El Bandoneon) but at much lower fidelity.  
For the Ricardo Tanturi orchestra with vocalist 
Alberto Castillo, the Solo Tango release, 
Tanturi/Castillo is a great choice.  
The Tanturi/Castillo CDs, Tangos de mi Ciudad and 
El Tango es el Tango are also quite good.

The next challenge is to move onto the music of De Angelis, 
Pugliese and Biagi.  
The music of Alfredo De Angelis provides a good bridge 
from Di Sarli to Pugliese because the De Angelis 
orchestra played solid dance music that has a feel between 
the smoothness of Di Sarli and the drama of Pugliese.  
For Alfredo De Angelis, either From Argentina to the World or 
Instrumentales Inolvidables would be a good choice.

For a dancer moving onto the more challenging rhythms 
of Pugliese, the CD Ausencia captures dance classics 
from both early and later in his career, showing his 
transition from more solid dance rhythms to the more 
challenging, but wonderfully compelling La Yumba beat.  
The CD Instrumentales Inolvidables is a good second choice.

Rodolfo Biagi -- who was a pianist in the first 
Juan D'Arienzo Orchestra -- took D'Arienzo's direction 
of playing in a 2x4 rhythm but added striking rhythmic
elements of his own. 
Dancers who are comfortable with D'Arienzo's music are ready 
to tackle Biagi's music. 
For those first listening and moving to Biagi, good 
choices are Sus Exitos con Falgas y Ibanez (EMI Reliquias) 
and the somewhat lower fidelity Campo Afuera (El Bandoneon).

Where to Buy
------------

Despite a growing number of releases over the past few years, 
distribution remains limited, and availability is a constant issue 
in obtaining recordings of Argentine tango music suitable for dancing.  
For purchases in the United States, keep your eyes open and visit 
lots of compact disc stores and be prepared to mail order.  
Barnes and Noble bookstores occasionally have a few CDs of good tango 
music for social dancing -- particularly on the Blue Moon and El Bandoneon 
and Harlequin labels -- along with extensive stocks of tango music 
completely unsuitable for social dancing.  
Some large local stores near universities also stock a fair number of 
tango recordings, some of which may be suitable for social dancing.

Of the dealers in the United States, TangoCD.com has the most 
extensive list of recordings.  
Zival's Tango Store in Buenos Aires has the most extensive list of 
recordings and ships promptly.  
Owing to the distance, Zival's shipping costs are high and are best spread 
across a big order.  
In the United Kingdom, Mike Lavocah's milonga.co.uk, has an extensive list 
of available recordings.  
In Germany, Danza y Movimiento has an extensive list of recordings.
